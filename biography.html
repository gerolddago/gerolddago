        <br> <br>
        At the age of 19, <br> I have just finished my second year of 3d, currently a student in the Paris region. <br>

        I have grown up and still reside in the Yvelines department, and I was born in Abidjan, the economic capital of CÃ´te d'Ivoire, which is why I hold dual French-Ivorian citizenship. <br>
        <br> <br>
        In terms of Design and creation, <br>
        I perceive 3D as an art form, a tool that enables us to express our vision of things. <br>
        In my case, I am particularly fond of minimalist and modern themes, as I feel a strong attachment to them. <br>
        <br>
        And Although I am in my second year, the current academic year 2022/2023 truly represents my first year in the 3D axis, as the previous year was focused on general studies.
